# Transform In / Out vsts suite

## Midi-Filter

Filter some midi change controller message from passing thru.

## Program change

Sets a midi channel on an hardware synth when the active button is true, on false, all notes note are kept playing until release.


## Seemless Switch

Basically does the same as Program Change for not playing but does not send program changes because the VST Settings are all done by the DAW.

## Single Note

All notes On / Off are wired to a single note playing. This allows to keep arpegiator continuing until all notes are off.
